Baseline 0-D Brayton cycle turbofan model for adaptive engine research
Phase 2 Scope
Phase-2 shock and bump-geometry studies focus only on fully compressible supersonic regimes (Mach > 1.00000). Transonic cases (0.95000–0.97000) are excluded in Phase 2 to avoid mixed compressible/incompressible flow and to keep shock behavior interpretable.

# Adaptive-Engine-Baseline-Model  
**Ultra–Lightweight Adaptive Cycle Engine – Phase 2 (Baseline 0-D Engine Model + Thermodynamic Validation)**  
Author: **Maxon Ericsson**

## Project Overview
This repository contains the **baseline thermodynamic model** and **Phase 2 validation outputs** for a next-generation **three-stream adaptive cycle engine** digitally integrated with a **morphing diverterless supersonic inlet**.  
The goal of this project is to develop, validate, and publish an open-source propulsion framework suitable for early NGAD-class conceptual design.

Phase 2 focuses specifically on:

-  0-D Brayton cycle baseline turbofan model  
-  Integrated component flow: **compressor → combustor → turbine → nozzle**  
-  Thrust, specific impulse, fuel flow predictions  
-  Sensitivity analyses (ambient temperature, compressor pressure ratio)  
-  Automated high-resolution performance plots  
-  JupyterLab-based validation notebook
